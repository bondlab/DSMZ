# DSMZ

Resequencing of G. sulfurreducens DSMZ strain after ordering in 2020, re-isolating, and annotating based on G. sulfurreducens PCA strain. Two colony types were present in DSMZ stock, but differed in only a few bases. Sequence reconciled to 100% agreement with Breseq. Key differences include multiple transposons or truncations primarily affecting GSU 1515, 2592, 3594, ptsI, recJ, and apt genes. Also, errors in the assembly of PCA in the large repetitive protein in the omcZ operon GSU2073 were corrected, making it significantly larger.
